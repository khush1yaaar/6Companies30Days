So tommorow is newyear 2024 and my end sem exam are literally starts from 18th jan fully covering next 30 days easily.
I'm expecting myself to score like 9.2 this time(I scored 7.4 & 7.6 in last semesters). I must sound crazy and I kinda like it.
still I'm starting this challenge having so many second thoughts.
I'm pretty sure, I will preoritize my academics as soon as I realize that this can wait and my CGPA needs to be prioritized.
just like shraddha di said.
so the conclusion is - I'll do the challenge as soon as I'm free with my exams.
